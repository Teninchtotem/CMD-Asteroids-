# CMD-Asteroids-
Basic Asteroids game I made in my first year of university that runs entirely in the console window

Being new to programming at the time I only knew how to mess around in the console window, But that didn't stop me! I knew I wanted to make a game and so this was the result. My very first little passion project! And for that, it will always hold a special place in my heart.
